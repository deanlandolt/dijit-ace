Dijit/Ace Integration
=====================

This is an integration of ajax.org's ace editor with dojo's dijit widget system.


Usage
-----
Clone the latest versions of ace, dojo, dijit (and optionally dojox) and add 
[this AMD plugin](https://gist.github.com/1150715) as text.js in the same location 
(at least until Ajax.org addresses [this issue](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/issues/374)).


License
-------

I'd like this to eventually see this rolled into dijit, so the standard Dojo Foundation 
[dual license](https://github.com/dojo/dojo/blob/master/LICENSE) works.
